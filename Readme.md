This repo contains codes to produce all the figures showed in "The timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control", by Di Lauro, Miller and Kiss. Preprint available at 
https://scholar.harvard.edu/joelmiller/publications/timing-one-shot-interventions-epidemic-control
Please cite the paper if using these algorithms.

Note: after a round of revision, two new files were added to the repo. The first one is called matrix_generation, and allows to 
generate realisations of different mixing matrices, to get the results of figures 5,7-9
the second file is called metapop_strats and generates the plots of figure 5,7-9. 

For any queries, do not hesitate to contact me (F.Di-Lauro-at-sussex.ac.uk) or dr. Joel Miller (joel.c.miller.research-at-gmail.com).
